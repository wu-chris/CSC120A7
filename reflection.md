- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I overloaded sellCoffee method and added a int variable indicated number of cups of coffee customers would like to buy. I think it would be easier for customers if they would like to buy multiple cups of the same coffee.
I overloaded returnBook in cafe to make people can return an array of books at the same time.
I overloaded isResident in house to output a default message if no inputs is taken.
I overloaded constructer for all the subclasses and make a default constructer.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
At first, I struggled with overloading methods. I could not figure out what to do with all the existed methods. So I went to TA hours and asked. Then I realised I can rewrite anything and take in any other parameters I want in a method. So I chose methods and overloaded them. It all went smoothly after I figured out what exactly I should do. I recommend future students to figure out differences between overload and override first and do not hesitate to ask when questions come up.
